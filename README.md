# Readme for twitchspot-taxonomy

Taxonomy system for Twitchspot. Serves information on biological taxonomies and
species names.

This is part of a personal project that has been going on, with very variable
commitment (!), for around 20 years. The purpose of the project has been to
experiment with both different programming languages and technologies for
manipulating and serving information on biological taxonomies and names, as
well as different solutions for creating checklists and reporting observations.

Twitchspot is the general name of this project. This particular git project is
a new and simpler take on managing world lists of bird names and providing a
simple read only HTTP API for accessing this information.
