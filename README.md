# Readme for twitchspot-taxonomy

Twitchspot is the name of my personal project for experimenting with different
programming languages and technologies for manipulating and serving information 
on biological taxonomies and names, as well as different solutions for creating
checklists and reporting observations. This has been an ongoing project, with
very varying commitment for around 25 years. A lot of older code is not in this
repository

Twitchspot-taxonomy is an HTTP API that serves information on biological
taxonomies and species names. It also comprises a few command line tools for
importing taxonomical data to the system from different sources.

## Development

### Requirements

 * Python 3 & virtualenv.
 * Flask
 * Docker for running the HTTP API server.

### Setup development

Set up a Python virtualenv in the top directory of this project:
```bash
$ virtualenv env
```

Jump into to the virtualenv and install required Python modules:
```bash
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build

TBD.

### Run locally

TBD.

### Tests

TBD.

### Directory structure

 * 'data' contains taxonomic data files from external data sources.
 * 'taxonomyd' contains source code for the HTTP API server.
 * 'src' contains source code for various data import and transformation scripts.

## Data sources

The two data sources used, are [IOC Master lists](https://www.worldbirdnames.org/new/ioc-lists/master-list-2/) and [Birdlife Sweden's official list of Swedish names of birds](https://birdlife.se/tk/svenska-namn-pa-varldens-faglar/).
